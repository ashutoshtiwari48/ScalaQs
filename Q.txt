JQ1:(optional for post assessment, but must for pre)
Write generic Stack class in Java with below specification
- size operation returns the size 
- top operation to peek top element without removing 
- pop operation which removes the top element 
- push operation which pushes into stack 


SQ2. Create a csv file 
name,age,salary
ABC,2,3.0
XYZ,2,4.0
ABCD,10,9.0
AXYZ,10,18.0
Read this file and convert to immutable.List[Person]
where Person is case class with attributes name,age,salary 
Then find  age vs sum of salary (ie groupby on age)


SQ3.Write a case class Complex(not generic) with handling of + and comparison operation 
Complex has two args real, img and + adds real part and imaginary part of this with other
Then Create a List of few Complex numbers and do sorting on them 
Then create a List of few Numbers and do an operation which sum's all real parts and all imaginary parts 



SQ4.Enhance above class with + operation with any T as RHS 
which has Numeric implicits conversion  as well operation possible 
with Double as LHS of + operations 
//Use case 
Complex(1,2) + 2
2 + Complex(2,3)



SQ5:(Optional)Enhance above class with Generic  T wich has numeric implicits
