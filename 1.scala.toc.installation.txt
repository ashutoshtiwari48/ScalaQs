2. Each must have machine to work on as this is workshop oriented(any std machine, eg windows 7/8/10 with 4GB , harddisk-10 GB would do)
3. Each must have internet connection

##Installation  
1. JDK8 prerequiste is must, set JAVA_HOME 

2.For example for windows 
  Download zip https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/download/v1.1.2/sbt-1.1.2.zip
  Unzip on C:\Users\<<UserName>>\sbt
3. Open a command prompt 
$ setx PATH C:\Users\<<UserName>>\sbt\bin 

4.Make a sub dir  'training'
 Download https://github.com/ndas1971/ScalaQs/forSbtConsole.zip
 Copy that dir contents from zip file to  'training'
 It has '2.forSbtConsole\build.sbt' file along with others 
$ cd training\forSbtConsole
 execute in command prompt 
$ sbt console
 It would download many jars etc , wait for that 

##DONT DO THIS STEP for offline install : Quick download -
https://github.com/ndas1971/ScalaQs/blob/forSbtConsoleTrunc.zip
Copy that dir contents from zip file to  'training'
it has has 'forSbtConsoleTrunc\build.sbt' file along with others 
$ cd training\forSbtConsoleTrunc
 execute in command prompt 
$ sbt console
 
#other options for  Download , scala 11.x
